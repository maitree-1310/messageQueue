## RabbitMQ Implementation

This file describes the key points of the RabbitMQ implementation for this project.

* Leverages Spring AMQP: This enables seamless integration with the RabbitMQ message broker. Spring AMQP provides a high-level
  abstraction over the AMQP protocol, simplifying message exchange between applications.

* Establishes Asynchronous Communication: Producers publish messages to designated queues, decoupling message delivery from processing.
  This improves scalability and fault tolerance, as messages can be delivered and processed independently.

* Implements Message Consumption: Consumers subscribe to queues, ensuring timely retrieval and processing of messages.
  Consumers can be implemented as separate services or integrated within the main application, depending on the project's needs.
